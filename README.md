# AdvancedWakeuplight

This is an arduino MEGA project for creating a LED strip wakeuplight.

In addition to being a wakeup light there are also mood light functions:
* Static RGB color - set by individual R G B values
* Rainbow - slowly changing colors.
* Pulse - configurable RGB pulse. You can set the initial R G B values, the width of the delta for each R G B value, and the velocity for each R G B value - for spetacular effects.

Good starting point for the 12V LED strip:

(uses a different LED strip, but got examples for LCD display/keyboard
